### Howdy, I'm DannyðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤ 

<h3 align="left">A Little About Me:</h3>
<p align="left">A thirty year old web developer based in Darlington. I love creating innovative, simple and clean web applications that provide real value to the end user and delivering this within a set timescale which meets the clientâ€™s requirements.

I enjoy learning and trying to stay up-to-date with the latest web development trends and technologies and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skill set.

When I'm not coding, you will usually find me in the gym or enjoying a coffee whilst building some Star Wars lego sets. I enjoy watching sports, attending gigs and visiting America.

Thanks for stopping by my website! Feel free to get in touch if you'd like to hire me, collaborate on a project or just want to chat about web development.</p>
